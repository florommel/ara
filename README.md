ARA - Automatic Realtime-System Analyzer
========================================

Tool to automatically analyse realtime-systems.
Currently capable of FreeRTOS and OSEK.

Building
--------

The following dependencies are needed:

- [meson](https://mesonbuild.com/) (>=0.48.0)
- [llvm](http://llvm.org/) (==7.0)
- [cython](https://cython.org/) (>=0.26.1)
- [python](https://www.python.org/) (>=3.6)


To build the program type:
```
meson build
cd build
ninja
```
(Note: `build` is actually a placeholder for an arbitrary path.)

Usage
-----

To run the program `arsa.py` needs to be executed with the correct `PYTHONPATH`.
For convenience a small wrapper script is generated by meson that sets the correct environment variables. Run this with:
```
build/arsa.sh -h
```

Test Cases
----------

There are some predefined test cases. Run them with:
```
cd build
meson test
```

Architecture
------------

ARA is devided into steps that operate on the same system model. When starting the program the correct chain of steps is calculated and then executed. A listing of the steps can be retrieved by:
```
build/arsa.sh -l
```
Steps can be written into Python (defined in `steps`) or in C++ (defined in `steps/native`).
The model is written in C++ with Python bindings (defined in `libgraph`).
